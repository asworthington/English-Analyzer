# English Analyzer

## Overview

The English Analyzer is a C++ program designed to analyze a paragraph of text input from a file. It calculates various linguistic metrics including the number of characters, words, sentences, simple and complex sentences, occurrences of "to be" verbs, and the average number of words per sentence.

## Features

- Reads a paragraph of text from a specified file.
- Counts the total number of characters in the paragraph.
- Tokenizes the paragraph into individual words and punctuation marks.
- Calculates the total number of words in the paragraph.
- Determines the number of sentences based on common sentence-ending punctuations ('.', '?', '!')
- Identifies simple sentences and complex sentences based on conjunction usage.
- Counts occurrences of "to be" verbs ("am", "are", "is", "was", "were") and variations ("to" and "be").
- Computes and displays the average number of words per sentence.

## Notes

- Ensure the input file contains valid text and is accessible to the program.
- The program handles basic text analysis and assumes standard English grammar rules.
- Results may vary depending on the complexity and structure of the input paragraph.
- This program is designed for educational purposes to demonstrate basic text analysis techniques using C++.

## Usage

1. Compile the `EnglishLab.cpp` program using a C++ compiler.
2. Run the compiled executable and follow the prompts to enter the filename containing the text paragraph.
3. View the analysis results displayed, including character count, word count, sentence count, etc.
